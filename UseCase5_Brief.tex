\textbf{Set Time Between Measurements for the System:  }\\
The System Administrator sets the Mesurement Times for the system.
The Mesurement Time is the elapsed time between measurements the
System performs.\\\\
I.E. If the Measurement time is set to be 10
minutes, then the System would measure and record the weather data
every 10 minutes.\\\\
The System sets the Measurement Time commanded by the System
Administrator, and returns validation of that new time.
