\textbf{Use Case U1:  Request Current Weather Data}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Weather Station\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }Request Heat Index Data\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }N/A\\
\textbf{Stakeholders and Interests:}
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Wants accurate and current Heat Index data
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The Weather Station is running.\\
\textbf{Success Guaranties  (Postconditions):} 
Heat Index Data is returned to the requesting user.\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario: }\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Request Heat Index Data in the requested units (Metric, English,
Absolute). & \\\hline
&2.  Retrieves the Temperature Data.\\\hline
&3.  Retrieves the Humidity Data.\\\hline
&4.  Calculates the Heat Index.\\\hline
&5.  Converts the Heat Index to the requested units.\\\hline
&6.  Presents the Heat Index to the User in the requested
units.\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows:  }\\
2a.  If the System cannot measure the Temperature,
then the System informs the User the Dewpoint cannot be measured:
stating the reason.\\\\
2b.  If the Heat Index cannot be calculated accurately, then the
System informs the User the Heat Index cannot be calculated
accurately.\\\\ 
3a.  If the System cannot measure the Humidity, then
the System informs the User the Dewpoint cannot be measured:
stating the reason.\\\\
\textbf{Special Requirements:  }Both the Temperature and Humidity are
need for Heat Index Calculation.\\\\
\textbf{Technology and Variations List:  }\\ 
2a.  The temperature must be converted to degrees Fahrenheit to
calculate the Heat Index in the current formula.\\\\
2b.  The temperature must be above 70 degrees Fahrenheit to
accurately calculate the Heat Index.\\\\
\textbf{Frequency of Occurrence:  }Could be nearly continuous.\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider using another heat index calculation that is accurate
below 70 fahrenheit (if it makes sense to do so).
