\textbf{Use Case U1:  Request Current Weather Data}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Weather Station\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }Request Dewpoint Data\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }N/A\\
\textbf{Stakeholders and Interests:}
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Wants accurate and current Dewpoint data
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The Weather Station is running.\\
\textbf{Success Guaranties  (Postconditions):} 
Dewpoint Data is returned to the requesting user.\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario: }\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Request Dewpoint Data in the Requested Units (Metric, English,
Absolute). 
& \\\hline
&2.  Retrieves the Temperature Data.\\\hline
&3.  Retrieves the Humidity Data.\\\hline
&4.  Calculates the Dewpoint.\\\hline
&5.  Converts the Dewpoint to the requested units.\\\hline
&6.  Presents the Dewpoint to the User in the requested units.\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows:  }\\
2a.  If the System cannot measure the Temperature,
then the System informs the User the Dewpoint cannot be measured:
stating the reason.\\\\
3a.  If the System cannot measure the Humidity, then
the System informs the User the Dewpoint cannot be measured:
stating the reason.\\\\
\textbf{Special Requirements:  }Both the Temperature and Humidity
are needed for calculation.\\\\
\textbf{Technology and Variations List:  }None\\\\ 
\textbf{Frequency of Occurrence:  }Could be nearly continuous.\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider calibrating dewpoint via the Dry Bulb, Wet Bulb
formula
\end{itemize}
