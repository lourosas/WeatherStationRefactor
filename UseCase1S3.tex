\textbf{Use Case U1:  Request Current Weather Data}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Weather Station\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }Request Barometric Pressure Data\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }N/A\\
\textbf{Stakeholders and Interests:}
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Wants accurate and current Barometric Pressure data
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The Weather Station is running.\\
\textbf{Success Guaranties:  (Postconditions)} 
Barometric Pressure Data is returned to the requesting user.\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario: }\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Request Barometric Pressure Data in the desired Units (Metric,
English, Absolute). 
& \\\hline
&2.  Retrieves the Barometric Pressure.\\\hline
&3.  Converts the Barometric Pressure the the requested units\\\hline
&4.  Presents the Barometric Pressure to the User.\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows:  }\\
*a.  If at any time, the System cannot measure the Barometric Pressure,
then the System informs the User the humidity can not be measured.\\\\
